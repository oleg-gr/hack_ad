SpaceApps Hackathon 2013, NYUAD team
An educational platform, which promotes computer science, engineering and apce amongst kids. Kids are practically able to create their own mindstorms (running our custom firmware).
The midstorm "talks" to an Android phone, which acts like a bridge, which is constantly pinging our server.
Our server serves the child a javascript interpreter, where they program in a pseudo-python-turtle type language so they can learn about stuff like defining methods, loops and conditionals.
The code children write is live:
	when a child writes "fd(w)", the robor immediately starts moving forward for 2 seconds.

The goal is to teach kids not only about engineering and computer science, but also about the advantage of building more autonomous systems, like writing larger methods.
The system is going to work with a delay naturally imitating the way NASA works with delay on their rovers.
