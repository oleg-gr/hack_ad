DisCoS (Distributed Control System) is a framework for creating distributive intelligence within any group of networked devices. Its innovation comes from the idea of sending missions rather than commands. The master distributes dynamically generated high level programs that it sends throughout the network to controllers, in a sense, distributing partial autonomy and intelligence throughout the system whilst maintaing full centralized control. This is made possible by the .bot programming language we created specifically for DisCoS. We demonstrate one implementation of a full DisCoS system in creating the TNT learning & robotics platform, giving students the ability to write live code and dynamic programs that are immediately interpreted and run on Lego NXT rovers on the fly
